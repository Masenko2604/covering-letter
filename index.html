 <p>Hello! My name is Tetyana.<br />
I'm a beginner front-end developer.<br /> I got my first development experience at GoIT Academia. The training consisted of
80% practice and 20% theory. During this time, I regularly completed homework, solved interactive problems in JavaScript
and worked in a team on interesting projects, which allowed me to gain basic knowledge and skills: HTML5, CCS3,
JavaScript, React.js, TypeScript, Node.js. Upon completion of our training, we were given the opportunity to develop
further by acquiring other skills. I'm currently working on a project in Next.js, taking intensive Czech language
courses/level B2 and improving my English level.
I can write relatively simple code, understand the application development cycle, and understand how application
databases and services work.
In my future work, I expect interesting projects, a pleasant atmosphere in the team and opportunities for professional
development.
I want to use the knowledge and experience gained for the development and prosperity of your company!<br />
Thank you for your time!<br />
Have a good day!<br /> </p>
