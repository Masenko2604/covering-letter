 <h1>Motivation letter</h1>

 <p>Hello!<br />
My name is Tatyana Masyenko, and I'am excited about the opportunity to join your team as a Frontend Developer. My
journey in IT began when I discovered a passion for development, which led me to successfully complete the FullStack
Developer course at GoIT. Through this program, I gained hands-on experience with key technologies such as HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, TypeScript, and responsive/adaptive design.</p>

<p>In addition to these core technologies, I have worked with MongoDB, Postman, VSCode, Figma, and Trello. I'am
continuously improving my skills, including advancing my proficiency in the Czech language. My English level is
sufficient for understanding technical documentation and participating in professional communication.</p>

<p> My studies, I participated in several team-based projects, which provided valuable experience in building web
applications using React.js. This included working with styled components, implementing application forms, creating
responsive designs, and adding simple animations. These projects enhanced both my technical skills and my ability to
collaborate effectively within a team environment.</p>

<p>I'am confident in my ability to write clean, maintainable code and have a solid understanding of the full application
development lifecycle, including how databases and services interact within an application.</p>

<p>My primary goal is to secure a remote position that offers both professional growth and stability for my family. I'am
eager to deepen my knowledge, continuously improve my qualifications, and contribute meaningfully to your projects. With
my practical experience, enthusiasm, and commitment to self-improvement, I believe I can be a valuable asset to your
team and help develop high-quality products and services.</p>

<p></p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to your team and work on
exciting and challenging projects.<br /> </p>
