 <p>Hello! My name is Tetyana.<br />
I'm a beginner front-end developer.<br /> completed the courses and I want to start my career in IT. During my studies, I gained basic skills in HTML5, CCS3,
responsive/responsive design, JavaScript, React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Postman. MongoDB, VITE, GIT, VERCEL. I can
write relatively simple code, understand the application development cycle, and understand how application databases and
services work.
In my future work, I improve my knowledge of Czech and English and acquire new skills that can be useful at work. I can
speak English at a level sufficient to read documentation and communicate. I like to learn new things and use my
knowledge in practice. I need an internship under the guidance of an experienced specialist. The internship does not
require payment. I prefer working from home or a hybrid format. I expect interesting projects, a pleasant atmosphere in
the team and opportunities for professional development.
In my future work, I expect interesting projects, a pleasant atmosphere in the team and opportunities for professional

I want to use the knowledge and experience gained for the development and prosperity of your company!<br />
Thank you for your time!<br />
Have a good day!<br /> </p>
